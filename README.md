# DemonicControl
DemonicControl is a control meta script that runs with vtank for Asheron's Call. Its aim is to make the normal drudgery of playing the game a bit easier.

I began writing it for myself to make traveling easier. It is customized for the [DragonMoon](http://discord.gg/dragonmoon) server.
